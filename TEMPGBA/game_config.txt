# gpSP game settings database

# What is this file??? game_config.txt is a database of settings on a
# per-game basis. A couple of the settings are required to make games
# work at all, but most of them are there to improve the performance of
# a game. If a game doesn't work then look through the settings here,
# but keep in mind that this file can not be used to fix a majority of
# games, the ones that don't work because of emulator bugs. For those
# you'll have to wait for a new release and hope it someday gets fixed.

# This file is meant to be edited in plain text, with a normal editor.
# game_name, game_code, and vender_code can be found in the game's header.
# All three must match for the game to be used, and those setting must be
# in that order. Be sure to use [!] ROMs (verified by GoodGBA) when
# building this list. Right now I don't know how much overlap there is
# between different region games, but usually idle loops don't apply to
# them. If you're using a different region than the one in here you can
# try copying the entry, it might improve it.

# You can also find the three identifying codes on the second line from
# the top in gpSP's main menu. So anyone should be able to add settings
# to this file if they know what to set, but for some options it'll take
# a lot of special knowledge for them to be of any use. Be sure to see if
# your game is already here, but only if the game_name/game_code/
# vender_code all match. Only the first full match's settings will be used.

# Everything here is case sensitive. Don't mess with this file unless
# you know what you're doing - if in doubt sooner ask someone who does.

# I mainly focus on USA versions, so try those first. And, just because
# a game is on here doesn't mean the game actually works in the current
# version. :/

# These are the following options:

# idle_loop_eliminate_target - tells the recompiler that this branch
#  is an idle loop and thus a hardware update should follow it every
#  time. This is purely a speed improvement and is not meant to improve
#  compatibility - if it does it represents a strange timing problem in
#  the game. You can only set one of these for now. Don't use this if
#  you don't know what you're doing, it can break the game. Some games
#  will run miserably slowly without this option.

# translation_gate_target - tells the recompiler to put an indirect
#  branch (gate) at this point, so artificially stop the current block.
#  This is useful if the game performs self modifying code from within
#  the same block it is currently executing - this can prevent it from
#  causing SMC hits far more times than it should. This is also only a
#  speed hack; you can have up to 8 of these. Don't use this if you don't
#  know what you're doing, they'll just make the game slower and are
#  rarely helpful (good for Camelot games).

# iwram_stack_optimize - set this to "no" to turn it off. By default this
#  is set on. It will turn off an optimization that assumes that the stack
#  is always in IWRAM, and thus makes ldm/stm relative to the stack much
#  faster. Turning it off will degrade game speed slightly, but is
#  necessary for a few games that don't follow this convention.

# flash_rom_type - set this to 128KB if the game has a 128KB flash ROM,
#  otherwise leave it alone or you might break game saving. If you get
#  a white screen when the game starts try this option.

# bios_rom_hack_39 - a hack that allows "roll" to work with the correct BIOS
#  in Zelda: Minish Cap.

# bios_rom_hack_2C - like the above but allows Rayman Advance to work.

# Pokemon Emerald (E/U)
# I don't know why this has an idle loop when Ruby doesn't....
